This Network visualization is a digital representation of citations in two Chinese constitutional drafts (1923 and 1936), created as a part of the PhD project by Dr Fupeng LI, [The Cultural Translation of the Weimar Constitution in China (1919-1949)](https://www.rg.mpg.de/research/social-revolution-of-the-constitution), developed under the guidance of Prof. Thomas Duve at the [Max Planck Institute for European Legal History](https://www.rg.mpg.de/). Due to the efforts of Dr Andreas Wagner, not only does it transform the scattered data into vivid networks, but it also makes the hidden connections visible and systematized, thereby facilitating a deeper analysis on how China translated the Weimar constitution, especially concerning the social rights, within embedded reference systems composed of foreign constitutions and Chinese resources.

The main visualization uses a *hierarchical edge bundling* visualization (cf. Holten 2006), implemented by the [graph-tool library](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/) (Peixoto 2014). Our own routines that are putting this library to work can be seen in the Jupyter notebook [Fupeng_Li.ipynb](./Fupeng_Li.ipynb).
